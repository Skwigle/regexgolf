Regexgolf Solutions with Explanations.

This answer key is in reference to the Regular Expression game/tutorial "Regexgolf" which can be found at:

https://regex.alf.nu/

I am going through the lessons with absolutely no knowledge of Regular Expressions. While going through the lessons, I
noticed that there was nowhere to find a "hint" or explanation of anything taking place. There were points where I was
getting answers that were wrong due to something I didn't understand. I would look at my incorrect answer, then look at my
correct answer and not understand why the previous answer was incorrect. A couple of them I still don't understand. This will
be a work in progress, so certain aspects might not be explained properly quite yet. There might even be times where my whole
guide is "I was kind of messing around, stumbled upon this answer that somehow works....I don't quite get it either, but I
will let you know as soon as I do!"

I will try my best to help everyone out as much as I can and I will try to explain things as thoroughly as I can to make sure
people of all experience levels can understand these guides.

Disclaimer: The text book I'm using as a reference is an online site called Google. You might've heard of it. I have an
answer guide as well as explanations of it all, but frustration followed by epiphany is not only one of the greatest feelings
in the world, but also one of the best ways to learn. With this key, you might "learn it", but it wont stick nearly as well
as you would if you put in the work to learn it by yourself. One trick I definitely noticed: After a couple levels, I would
look at a new lesson and hit a brick wall. My brain wasn't processing anything anymore. The trick I used to fix that? Walk
away. Calm yourself down, relax, play some games, read a book, anything. Most of the time I would come back and see the
answer immediately. Don't discourage yourself. Learning this is productive, bringing yourself down is not. Good luck and have
fun!
