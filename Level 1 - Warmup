So you decided to try Regex Golf, either to test your skills with Regular Expressions, or simply as a fun way to learn how
Regular Expressions work and how to use them. Regex Golf is a game where you are trying to type in a Regular Expression to match
everything in the left column and nothing in the right column. You are shooting for the highest score (sorry golf aficionados.)
You receive ten points for every match in the left column, lose ten points for every match in the right column, and lose one
point for every character you use, so we're looking for small answers here. I will let you know, the way I went about a lot of
these answers was by taking whatever answer worked, and finding a way to simplify it or shrink it. So, if your code is
excessively long at first, try to find a way to shrink it!

So, for starters, I spent a lot of time sitting here just trying to figure out what exactly it was asking for. I was so used to
working with bash, that I was sitting here thinking "What is the command I put to search for things? I know grep, but that's not
what they're looking for. I don't get what they're exactly asking me." It turns out with Regex Golf, it is just very simply
asking what you are searching for. So, for example, take a look at Level 1 - Warmup. The goal is to look for a way to have every
word in the left column appear in the search results while nothing from the right column appears in those same search results.
The easiest way for me to start each level is to look at the pattern that is occurring in the left column.

For this level, the pattern is pretty obvious. If you look at all the words in the left column, you will see that every word
contains 'foo'. So you type in the word 'foo', and that's it! So, now that we have the answer to that and we know what they're
asking for, the next little bit should be a lot easier.

Answer: foo
