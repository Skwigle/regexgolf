I feel the need to tell you: This level's answer will be starting a little ridiculous, but it gets tame by the end, so make sure to stay with me here! Try to find the pattern! Once again, the pattern is a little more subtle this time. Now, I feel there is a term here I need to clarify: Cheat. They are not saying "Look up the answer and move on." The term "Cheat" in this sense is saying "make an expression that specifically works in this situation, but you will (more than likely) never actually use in the real world ever."
